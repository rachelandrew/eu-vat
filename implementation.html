        <p>As we all figure out what to do, it would be great if people could write up their implementation experience - either on their own blog or add a page here and link it up. While we can't assume that one business is identical to another, a lot of us are going to be using the same providers and selling the same sorts of products. Can we save each other some legwork by sharing what we have learned?</p>

        <h4>Services</h4>

        <p>As expected a variety of products and services are springing up to take advantage of people needing to comply with this legislation. Some of them have been fairly aggressively targetting anyone who posts about the issue. I have not used any of these, so you need to do your own research, but I'll list those I spot here. Of course these services just mean one more thing eating into your profit as they take a cut or flat fee.</p>
